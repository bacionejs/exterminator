A javascript game for the js13kgames 2024 competition  

The Exterminator scans for the number 13 hidden within the patterns of your room so you can eliminate them. But you have to hurry or they will overload the circuits.

This device uses the camera so make sure it has permission for your browser.

Controls: click/tap  
Tested on Android Chrome/Firefox.

Make sure the lights are on and that you have camera/video enabled in apps/chrome and chrome/settings.

After you click Scan, you should get some detections. If not, then move your phone back and forth. When you get some detections, you can click the scope to Capture them. Once captured, you must quickly smash them because they are not happy and will begin to zip around faster and faster until they overload your circuits.

Warning: Consumer protection groups have found that this device doesn't actually work to eliminate the number 13 from your environment. But if it makes you feel better, that is all that matters ;)
